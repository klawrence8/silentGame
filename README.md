Digital Art Installation for 2700

We wish to interpret the nature of collaboration and design.  Our thesis "Design is Layered" is expressed by our installation which combines physical media and digital media. The piece exposes the layers behind the act of appropriation and user-connectedness throughout the design process.

Instructions:
The first drafter has a black marker and draws an outline of a figure near the top of the whiteboard. Then the second drafter takes a webcam picture of the whiteboard and outlines the figure (without touching it) using the marker function of the computer program. The third drafter repeats the job of the first drafter on the board, using a colored marker. The first drafter follows using the webcam to capture the whiteboard drawing and then digitally outlines the figure using the digital marker. Then the second drafter followed by the third and fourth repeats this process until the last line is drawn and the edges of the canvas are reached.

Inspired by Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawing 797
